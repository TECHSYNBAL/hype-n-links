### Frontend Development

Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd front
```

Then follow the instructions in `front/README.md` for Flutter development.

### Adding New Services

1. Create a new directory (e.g., `backend/`, `rag/`)
2. Add service-specific `railway.json` in that directory
3. Update root `railway.json` to include the new service

## Railway Deployment

This monorepo is configured for Railway deployment with multiple services:

- **Root `railway.json`**: Defines all services and their source directories
- **Service `railway.json`**: Service-specific configuration (in each service directory)

Railway will automatically detect and deploy all services defined in the root configuration.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the service you want to work on (e.g., `cd front`)
3. Follow service-specific setup instructions
