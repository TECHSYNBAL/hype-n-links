# Fonts Directory

Place your Aeroport font files here:

- `Aeroport-Regular.ttf` (required)
- `Aeroport-Bold.ttf` (optional, for bold text)
- `Aeroport-Medium.ttf` (optional, for medium weight)
- `Aeroport-Light.ttf` (optional, for light weight)

## How to get Aeroport font:

1. Download from a font provider (Google Fonts doesn't have Aeroport, but you can find it on other font websites)
2. Extract the .ttf files
3. Place them in this directory
4. The font will automatically be used throughout the app

## Note:

If you don't have all the font files, you can modify `pubspec.yaml` to only include the files you have. The app will use the Regular weight as fallback.
